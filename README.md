# binary-music-player
This is a binary music player created using Python.
This generates a random song out of 10.
The counter is linear, but the song is not.
This project is based around another binary music player, which you can find <a href=https://github.com/tholman/binary-music-player/blob/master/>here</a>.
You can download the generated song from the page.
